Dear Colleagues,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

We are in the process of setting up the system and have successfully followed the instructions provided earlier. We are now at a stage where we require the following additional items to proceed further:

1. Encryption file for key generation (.key file)
2. VC configuration file
3. New certification for the VC system
4. Firmware for IP phone
5. User certificate for the IP phone
6. User certificate for the Internet router
7. Two signed certificates

For the phone configuration, we would appreciate it if you could verify the following details:
- Phone Model: SNOM D717
- MAC Address: 000413BEDD92
- Firmware Version: 10 A. 73.0

We are eager to complete this setup and your assistance with providing the above-mentioned items would be immensely valuable.

Best regards,
